  <h2 class="c013">PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p class="c014">A little more than a year ago the American National Red Cross, just
reorganized, consisted only of its sixty-five incorporators. Since then it
has not only organized Branches in twenty-six States and Territories,
but it has justified the claim that there is need for such an organization
in times of peace as well as war “to continue and carry on a system of
national and international relief in time of peace and apply the same
in mitigating the sufferings caused by pestilence, famine, fire, floods and
other great national calamities,” as stated in its charter, by the assistance
it has rendered after the typhoon of September 26, 1905, in the Philippines,
in the relief of the famine sufferers in Japan, to a limited extent
by the contributions sent for the victims of the Vesuvius eruption, and
lastly by its relief work after the great calamity that has befallen San
Francisco and its vicinity. Reports in regard to some of this relief work
are contained in this third Bulletin.</p>

<p class="c015">The Central Committee proposes later to issue to the officers of
Branches a circular letter recommending the appointment in all cities
and towns of Emergency Relief Committees consisting of representative
citizens, and of which the Mayor should be ex-officio chairman, which will
be called into active service only at times of great national calamities.</p>

<p class="c015">A translation is given in this Bulletin of the invitation extended through
the International Committee of Geneva by the British Red Cross to all
other Red Cross Societies to attend a Red Cross Congress to be held in
London, June, 1907.</p>

<p class="c015">The European Red Cross Societies have tens and hundreds of thousands
of members, and the Japanese has a membership of 1,035,000. The United
States, so long delayed in the creating of a great national Red Cross,
must make up for lost time by its activity and energy. To increase the
membership of the American Red Cross and thereby its efficiency and
strength the individual personal efforts of its members must be depended
upon. A national pride should be felt in the American Red Cross, and all
Americans, men, women and even children, who are able to pay the dollar
a year dues or twenty-five dollars for life-membership, should become
members of our National Red Cross. Application blanks will be found in
each Bulletin with the addresses of the Branch Secretaries to whom such
applications can be sent.</p>

  <h2 class="c013">JAPANESE FAMINE FUND</h2>
</div>

<p class="c014">The American National Red Cross has forwarded to the Japanese Red
Cross for the famine stricken provinces in northern Japan a total of
$265,855.67, of which $200,000.00 was received from the <i>Christian Herald</i>;
being contributions made to that paper. A list of the contributions received
from the <i>Christian Herald</i> from the Red Cross Branch Treasurers
and those made directly to the National Treasurer from the different
States is contained in this Bulletin.</p>

<p class="c015">On March 31st when $100,000 had been received by the Japanese Red
Cross the following letter was sent to the American National Red Cross:</p>

<p class="c020"><span class="sc">Tokyo</span>, March 31, 1906.</p>

<p class="c019"><span class="sc">Miss Mabel T. Boardman</span>,
<i>The American National Red Cross Society,
Washington, D.C.</i></p>

<p class="c019"><span class="sc">Dear Madam</span>:</p>

<p class="c018">We have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your esteemed favor
under date of the 22d, February.</p>

<p class="c018">A generous appeal for our famine sufferers in northeastern provinces
in Japan done by your President Roosevelt, whose sympathy with Japan
and her people we have highly appreciated has echoed to our shore, when
our own people have been throwing their effort in relieving the distressed,
whose conditions are beyond imagination terrible. From the date when
you mailed the letter up to this day the monies you sent to us in cable
remittances amount to $100,000.00 in gold, which we lost no time, in
compliance with your desire and under the direction of our Government,
in distributing to relieve the immediate necessities of the most needy
sufferers by forwarding a certain amount of money to each President of
our Red Cross Branches in those provinces, who are Governors and, at
the same time, we have had them conveyed to the sufferers all the kindness,
good-will and sympathy that have ever been extended to us by the
American people.</p>

<p class="c018">For the time being, we take pleasure in sending you an account of the
monies thus distributed to this date and will submit you a more accurate
account of the relief work later on.</p>

<p class="c018">We shall be greatly obliged to you if you kindly send us a list of those
donors’ names and addresses, who have contributed over $5.00.</p>

<p class="c018">Thanking you for your effort in collecting donations and for the practical
sympathy extended by your President, we are,</p>

<p class="c021">Yours obediently,</p>

<p class="c020">S. HIRAYAMA,<br />
<i>The Red Cross Society of Japan</i>.</p>

<p class="c015">The above letter enclosed the following financial statement:</p>

<p class="c019">The Red Cross Society of Japan.</p>

<p class="c015">In concluding a report made to the State Department in April on the
famine conditions Mr. Huntington Wilson, Charge d’Affaires, says:</p>

<p class="c015">“Americans may well feel pride in the splendid work done by the foreign
committee at Sendai of which the great majority, Dr. DeForest, Mr. W.
E. Lampe, the Rev. C. S. Davidson, Mr. M. B. Madden, and Mr. William
Axling, are citizens of the United States. The work of these men, and
the donations from the United States collected by the <i>Christian Herald</i>
and through the Red Cross Society, are like the President’s humanitarian
appeal, highly appreciated in Japan.</p>

<p class="c015">“While the prompt assistance rendered has doubtless been of great
value in alleviating suffering, and as a fine example of humanitarianism
there is no doubt that the Japanese Government and people can now
themselves readily cope with the needs of the final months of the famine.”</p>

<p class="c015">As the American people were ready and glad to aid Japan in the day
of her trouble so promptly has she turned to our help when calamity<span class="pageno" id="Page_5">5</span>
came to us in the disaster in California and as will be noted in the report
of the work done there the Japanese Red Cross has sent to the American
National Red Cross one hundred and ten thousand dollars ($110,000.00)
for the California sufferers, and for this generous contribution the American
people and especially those of California are most grateful and
appreciative.</p>

<p class="c015">On May 25th the following letter was received from the Japanese
Ambassador:</p>

<p class="c019"><span class="sc">Dear Miss Boardman</span>:</p>

<p class="c018">I take pleasure in informing you that I have been advised from my
home Government to the effect that the condition of the famine stricken
people in the Northern Provinces of Japan, towards the relief of whom
generous contributions from foreign sympathizers have been received,
has now improved to such a favorable extent as to allow them to announce
that, with the harvest of the coming summer crop, there will be no
more need of receiving outside contributions.</p>

<p class="c021">Yours sincerely,</p>

  <h2 class="c013">THE PRESENT CONDITION OF THE FAMINE-STRICKEN
DISTRICTS IN THE NORTHERN PART OF JAPAN</h2>
</div>

<p class="c032">BARON T. OZAWA, Vice-President</p>

<p class="c032">The Red Cross Society of Japan</p>

<p><i>To the American National Red Cross</i>:</p>

<p class="c015">Having been fully occupied in looking after all the affairs relative to
the relief work of the late war-victims, some of whom are still left behind
in our hospitals, I could spare no time otherwise up to this very
day, when, nevertheless, I found a few days to be squeezed out in order
to have realized my earnest desire of inspecting the present conditions
of the famine stricken districts in the Northern Provinces in Japan and,
besides, it was a proper time to be had for that purpose. Leaving Tokyo
on the 13th instant by a night train, in company with our Mr. Masatake
Togo, Honorary Secretary, and Mr. Kow Isobe, one of our clerks, and
arriving at Fukushima at 4 o’clock in the next morning, I started for
another journey escorted by Gov. Arita, President of the Fukushima
Red Cross Branch, and several other officers, and visited as many
counties, towns, and villages as possible meeting, at the same time, their
head men and officials, and dropping, once in a while, into the huts of
suffering peasants and telling them, upon every opportunity, how generous
and sympathetic President Roosevelt, members of the American National
Red Cross Society, proprietor of <i>Christian Herald</i> and its readers had
been in practically rescuing the famine stricken people from the verge of
starvation.</p>

<p class="c015">Before distributing the money, which you sent to us, however, we had
very carefully investigated the best methods, by which no peasant there
should laze away his time simply relying upon such helps. With this in
view, we instructed each Branch of our Society at those districts to provide
the poorest with foodstuffs.</p>

<p class="c015">An official instruction, No. 146, given by the Governor of Fukushima
Ken (Prefecture) on the 10th of March, 1906, to the head men of counties,
towns, and villages may be of interest to you. It runs as follows:</p>

<p class="c015">“The President of the United States has extended his sympathy to
Japan so deeply that he appealed to Americans in behalf of our famine
stricken provinces to raise a Relief Fund. As a result, we have
now received a certain amount of money as a part of contributions
from America which reached here through the channels of the Red
Cross Society of Japan, the Department of Home Affairs and the American
National Red Cross Society. I wish you would convey to your
sufferers the kindness and sympathy so practically shown to them by
Americans. This money should only be used to provide the sufferers
with food....”</p>

<p><span class="pageno" id="Page_8">8</span></p>

<p class="c015">The amount of money we sent to Fukushima Prefecture was up to
the 13th of April distributed among counties as follows:</p>

<p class="c015">The methods of helping that have been adopted by proper authorities
in co-operation with local officers of the Red Cross Society of Japan are
in general similar with those in other two Prefectures, and are applied
quite scientifically, if I could use such an expression. In classifying the
sufferers, for instance, the authorities have carefully inspected every
family in order to find to what extent and how its members should be
helped. The following is an example given to me by the President of
Iwate Red Cross Branch:</p>

<p class="c015">Thus, persons, men or women, who are quite unable to work, are fed
and clothed with contributions that have been made at home and abroad
towards the sufferers, whilst those who are able to work outside of the
house, are furnished by the local Governments, for measures of relief,
with wage-earning works such as those in rearranging public roads,
paddy fields, in opening new fields for mulberry trees, and those in the
house with materials for straw-works, bamboo-works, fishing-net-works,
etc., which are bought up afterward by the authorities dearer than ordinary
prices. Besides, to those sufferers, who own themselves even a
little bit of land or who are tenants, are furnished with seeds of various
kinds of vegetables without charges whatever. The wages they earn in
these ways run from 12 sen (6 cents) to 30 sen (15 cents) per day in
accordance with the degree of their laboring power.</p>

<p class="c015">Foodstuffs, which we purchased with the money you sent to us, consist
mostly of imported rice, wheat and flour.</p>

<p class="c015">The number of sufferers or paupers in Fukushima Prefecture is altogether
174,573, out of which 86,196 persons are helped in such a manner
as to be furnished with manual labor and 88,377 directly with foods,
which had been partly purchased by the authorities with the money contributed
from individuals to the amount of Yen 235,322.00 up to the
end of March and partly sent by them in the form of provisions in a good
quantity.</p>

<p class="c015">In Iwate Prefecture, there are 78,588 sufferers, out of whom 35,211
are altogether helped being totally unable to work. The total amount of
money, which we sent to this district out of your contributions, is up to
the 22d instant, Yen 58,276.37. Foodstuffs, worth Yen 24,619.08, had already
been distributed among the sufferers and at present some more foods
are being purchased. The total amount of money that has been contributed
by the natives and expended is to the same date Yen 147,933.60.</p>

<p class="c015">In Miyagi Prefecture, there are 475,135 persons, who have needed help
either directly or indirectly. Those who have been furnished with foodstuffs
number 51,058 and those with the manual labor number 424,077. The
total amount of money, which we sent to this district out of your contributions
is up to the 15th instant Yen 100,464.78 and that consisting of
donations made at home is Yen 448,892.70.</p>

<p class="c015">It may well be to state that, in consequence of the famine, there have
been established several societies in aid of the sufferers in these three
districts. The Ladies’ Relief Society in Fukushima, for instance, has
ever been collecting new and old clothes and distributed them among the
sufferers. The Society for the Protection of School Children, which was
established under the auspices of the authorities in each Prefecture of
those districts since the number of pupils had been found to be daily
decreasing, has done a great deal of work in helping and brightening
them. At present, as a result, the number of pupils who every day go
to school is figured out, on the average to be 95 per 100, whereas before
the famine, its percentage was about 85. All the text books, pencils, pens
and other necessities have now been pouring into their hands from
such children as are under different circumstances entirely. Such articles,
being in general second-handed, are disinfected thoroughly before
distributing them.</p>

<p><span class="pageno" id="Page_10">10</span></p>

<p class="c015">Thus the authorities have been taking much precaution against epidemic
that may likely spring up in the coming Summer as often should be the
case with famine. As the sufferers’ huts are apt to become more filthy
and unhealthy than used to be, policemen are frequently sent to such
houses for inspection. Moreover, on those who keep their own houses
clean are at present conferred prizes in the shape of money.</p>

<p class="c015">School-children, in addition, get free luncheons at the school, which
are served by the Society for the Protection of School-children. “I am
very hungry. Oh no! I am not hungry” is a spirit of Bushidoism or
Samurai. It may be of interest to state here that there had been at
first some children, who refused free luncheons notwithstanding they ate
nothing for more than two days and some fathers and mothers who refused
gifts from others.</p>

<p class="c015">In order to encourage the education of children in these districts, the
Central Government made allowance of Yen 300,000 for them, Yen
120,000 for Miyagi Ken (Prefecture), Yen 110,000 for Fukushima and
Yen 70,000 for Iwate Ken being respectively assigned.</p>

<p class="c015">The following, however, is the other side of society indispensably resulted
from the famine:</p>

<p class="c015">In Sendai City, at the beginning of the famine, all rice dealers constituted
a trust in order to enhance the market price of rice. Mayor
Hayakawa determinedly imported rice from Tokyo at his own risk to the
amount of about 102,600 bushels to check the trust, which was, in consequence,
almost panic-stricken and had to bring down the price lower
than before. Currency being scarce at the time in this district, he issued
temporary notes to be used for paying wages only on public works.
These notes could be exchanged for foods only, not for wine or liquor
nor for tobacco, and are even to-day in circulation among wage-earning
people there. I enclose herewith their samples.</p>

<p class="c015">Speaking generally, all sufferers have now been rescued from starvation
throughout these three famine stricken districts. It is not any
exaggeration to say that many lives have been saved through the generosity
of American people, and that every peasant, rich and poor, or
wise and ignorant, has more than highly appreciated the kindness and
sympathy you have extended to him so practically.</p>

<p class="c015">In Sendai City, at my request, Hon. Kamei, President of Miyagi Red
Cross Branch, introduced me to foreign missionaries living there, whose
names, it gives me great pleasure to mention here, were:</p>

<p><span class="pageno" id="Page_11">11</span></p>

<p class="c015">Mr. W. E. Lampe, Mr. C. S. Davison, Mr. C. Jacquet, Dr. J. H.
DeForest, Mr. M. B. Madden.</p>

<p class="c015">I dined with them and enjoyed the party to a full extent. Scarcely
need be said that these missionaries have played a great part especially
by this critical time in helping the sufferers. I have no doubt that the
former’s effort in enlightening, in addition, the latter in every respect
together with all classes of people must have been and will be more than
the whole Japan can repay.</p>

<p class="c015">At the close of this statement, I take great pleasure in adding that all
foodstuffs purchased with your contributions have been distributed among
the sufferers separately from others stating at each time to the effect
that those articles were the gifts of American people, to whom the
President Roosevelt and <i>Christian Herald</i> appealed for the alleviation in
behalf of the famine stricken districts. All the head men of counties,
towns and villages whom I met while on my trip requested me to convey
to you their heartfelt gratitude for all the kindness you have tendered
them. Enclosed is one of the letters of thanks, which has been addressed
and forwarded to our Count Matsukata from the representatives of the
sufferers, asking him to convey to you their highest appreciation.</p>

<p class="c015">Thanking you in anticipation for your kindness in reading this report,
which I now have the honor to submit to you.</p>

<p class="c015">We immediately bought rice with the money and distributed it among
the poor people of this village, fully explaining the philanthropic spirit
in which you sent it. The people, who were in extreme poverty and
could not follow their occupations, were deeply impressed by your kindness,
and felt ashamed at their lazy habit, swearing that they would rise
and exert themselves in future. They received the gift with tears of
gratitude and bowed heads.</p>

  <h2 class="c013">THE VESUVIAN RELIEF FUND</h2>
</div>

<p class="c014">The reports contained in the press of the suffering, and privation
caused by the eruption of Vesuvius determined the Executive Committee
of the Red Cross to issue an appeal to the public for the unfortunate
victims of this calamity. Therefore, on April 12th the Secretary of the
National Red Cross sent to all the Secretaries of the State Branches the
following telegram:</p>

<p class="c018">“Please announce in press Red Cross will forward contributions to
Italian Red Cross for Vesuvian disaster. Name local Treasurer.”</p>

<p class="c015">The work of securing contributions for this purpose had only just
begun when there occurred the great calamity caused by earthquake and
fire in California so that all the energies of the American people were
turned to render aid to their unfortunate countrymen at home, and thus
only a small amount was secured to be forwarded to the Italian Red
Cross for the relief of the Vesuvian victims.</p>

<p class="c015">The Secretary and Treasurer of the Berkshire Division of the Massachusetts
Red Cross Branch received the following letter from Italians
resident in Pittsfield:</p>

<p class="c020"><span class="sc">Pittsfield, Mass.</span>, April 30, 1906.</p>

<p class="c019"><span class="sc">Dr. Alfreda B. Withington</span>,</p>

<p class="c018"><span class="sc">Madam</span>:—Enclosed you will find check for $80.75 in behalf of the
suffering Italians who are victims of the Mt. Vesuvius eruption. We all
have the best of respect for the American Red Cross Society, and have
only thanks to offer you as their treasurer of the Berkshire Division for
the interest this division has thankfully offered their aid to our people.
If this collection had been made when all were working the cash
amount would have been larger, but under the fact that all laborers have
not been employed during the winter, they responded to the call for aid
the best they could. Your committee wishes to thank you personally for
your efforts for suffering humanity.</p>

<p class="c021">Signed,</p>

<p class="c020">JOHN SUTTY,<br />
JAMES LIBIZZI,<br />
ANTONIO CHIODE,<br />
JOHN F. COSTER,<br />
<i>Committee</i>.</p>

<p class="c015">Thus at the time of any great foreign calamity the natives of the
country in which the disaster has occurred and now residents of the
United States may feel that the American National Red Cross provides
a medium through which all contributions they may desire to make for
the benefit of the sufferers from such calamity, can be forwarded to the
Red Cross of their former country for administration without any expense
to the contributors.</p>

<p><span class="pageno" id="Page_13">13</span></p>

<p class="c015">The following are copies of telegrams sent by the Department of State
transmitting to the Italian Red Cross the contributions received by the

  <h2 class="c013">CALIFORNIA RELIEF</h2>
</div>

<p class="c014">On the morning of Wednesday, April 18th, before ten o’clock, the news
of the earthquake in California was received at Red Cross Headquarters
from the War Department. Immediately the following telegram was sent
to Judge Morrow, President of the California Red Cross Branch, and a
meeting of the Executive Committee was called for that afternoon:</p>

<p class="c020"><span class="sc">Washington</span>, <i>April 18, 1906</i>.</p>

<p class="c019"><i>Judge W. W. Morrow, President of California Red Cross, U. S. Circuit
Court, San Francisco, Cal.</i>:</p>

<p class="c018">Have just been advised of disaster. Can Red Cross be of assistance?</p>

<p class="c020">CHAS. L. MAGEE, <i>Secretary</i>.</p>

<p class="c015">Somewhat later in the day the following telegrams were sent to Judge
Morrow, the Honorable Horace Davis, Treasurer of the California Red
Cross, and to the Mayor of San Francisco:</p>

<p class="c020"><span class="sc">Washington</span>, <i>April 18, 1906</i>.</p>

<p class="c018">National Red Cross ready to aid San Francisco. Please confer with
Mayor as to best means of assistance. Reply care of War Department.</p>

<p class="c020">CHAS. L. MAGEE, <i>Secretary</i>.</p>

<p class="c020"><span class="sc">Washington</span>, <i>April 18, 1906</i>.</p>

<p class="c019"><i>To the Mayor of San Francisco</i>:</p>

<p class="c018">National Red Cross ready to aid San Francisco. How can most effective
service be rendered? Please confer with Judge Morrow and Hon.
Horace Davis of California Red Cross. Reply care of War Department.</p>

<p class="c020">CHAS. L. MAGEE, <i>Secretary</i>.</p>

<p class="c015">As it was found impossible to obtain a prompt reply to these dispatches
because of the condition of the telegraph service, it was decided at the
Executive Committee meeting to send to the Secretaries of the Red Cross
Branches the following telegram:</p>

<p class="c020"><span class="sc">Washington</span>, <i>April 18, 1906</i>.</p>

<p class="c018">Make Red Cross appeal for San Francisco. Name local Treasurer.</p>

<p class="c020">CHAS. L. MAGEE, <i>Secretary</i>.</p>

<p class="c015">On Thursday, April 19th, no word having been received from any of
the officers of the California Branch, the Hon. William H. Taft, President
of the Red Cross, appointed as special Red Cross Agent, Dr. Edward
T. Devine of New York, who had had experience in such relief
work at Johnstown and Baltimore. Dr. Devine being instructed to proceed
immediately to San Francisco, started Thursday afternoon. General
Funston, Judge Morrow and Mayor Schmitz were sent telegraphic notice
of his appointment.</p>

<p class="c015">Judge Morrow reported by letter later that directly after the disaster
he sent several dispatches to the National Red Cross, none of which were
ever received.</p>

<p><span class="pageno" id="Page_15">15</span></p>

<p class="c015">A large number of telegrams were received at Red Cross Headquarters
asking to whom car-loads of provisions donated for San Francisco were
to be consigned. Before Dr. Devine had started instructions were returned
to ship such supplies to General Funston. As soon as Dr. Devine
had started all further contributions of supplies of which the Red Cross
was notified were consigned to him as Special Red Cross Agent. A
report of these contributions will be given in a later Bulletin when a
fall report of contributions of money, food, clothing and other supplies
received by the Red Cross will be made.</p>

<p class="c015">April 25th, Dr. Devine telegraphed to the Red Cross that a consolidation
of the Finance Committee with the California Red Cross Branch
had been effected, which was entirely satisfactory to Judge Morrow,
President of the Branch. The new committee was called the “Finance
Committee of Relief and Red Cross,” Mr. James D. Phelan being chairman.
There was great local desire to have this consolidation recognized.
An immediate reply was sent as follows:</p>

<p class="c019"><i>Dr. Edward T. Devine, Red Cross Agent, San Francisco, Cal.</i>:</p>

<p class="c018">Executive Committee gladly recognizes Committee of Relief and Red
Cross. Will forward funds to credit of James D. Phelan. Law requires
Red Cross accounts to be audited by the War Department. Please keep
accounts so that this may be done.</p>

<p class="c020">ROBERT M. O’REILLY,<br />
<i>Chairman Red Cross Central Committee</i>.</p>

<p class="c015">On April 23d, the following telegram was sent to the Secretaries of
the Red Cross Branches:</p>

<p class="c020"><span class="sc">Washington</span>, <i>April 23, 1906</i>.</p>

<p class="c018">Appoint Committee of women to collect, sort, pack summer clothing,
blankets, linen, etc., to await further orders for shipment.</p>

<p class="c020">CHAS. L. MAGEE, <i>Secretary</i>.</p>

<p class="c015">This was succeeded on April 24th by the following instructions:</p>

<p class="c020"><span class="sc">Washington</span>, <i>April 24, 1906</i>.</p>

<p class="c018">Sort and pack contributions of clothing. Ship to Dr. Edward T. Devine,
Red Cross, San Francisco. Indicate as far as possible on outside nature
and contents of each box. Wire Dr. Devine of shipment. Report Red
Cross Headquarters by letter amount and character of shipment.</p>

<p class="c020">CHAS. L. MAGEE, <i>Secretary</i>.</p>

<p class="c015">On April 19th a request was made by the Maryland Red Cross to have
a contribution of $5,000 immediately forwarded to San Francisco. As
even the U. S. Treasury Department was as yet unable to get into communication
with the United States Mint there was no way of transmitting
these funds, and the President of the Red Cross telegraphed to General
Funston to inquire if relief funds would be of use there and received
word that such funds were not then required. The business portion of
the city had been so largely destroyed by fire there was nothing to be
purchased in the way of supplies.</p>

<p class="c015">Very shortly after the relief work for California began, the Western
Union Telegraph Company, the Postal Telegraph Company and the Long
Distance Telephone Company gave to the Red Cross the free use of<span class="pageno" id="Page_16">16</span>
their wires for all communications connected with this relief work. The
railroads and express companies throughout the country were most generous
in providing for the free transportation of supplies of various kinds
that the Red Cross Branches received for California. A more complete
acknowledgment of this will be made later when fuller data are obtained
from the reports of the Branch Societies.</p>

<p class="c015">The response made throughout the country to the appeal for the sufferers
from the great disaster was most generous and sympathetic, finding
expression in the children’s pennies as well as the checks for thousands
of dollars, and many interesting incidents were reported in the
letters from the State Branches. A Chicago letter says: “Little girls are
even bringing in dolls and dolls’ dresses for the little girls in San Francisco
who have lost theirs in the fire. Some of the incidents occurring in
the Armory where the ladies are receiving, packing and sending off
clothing, are most touching. Yesterday a boy about eleven or twelve
years of age came in, sat down on the floor and pulled off his shoes. He
was asked what he meant by doing that and he said: ‘Well you see it
is nearly summer time now and I can go bare-footed, so you can just
take them shoes and send them to one of them boys who is getting his
feet burned in them hot streets.’ It was with difficulty the little fellow
could be persuaded to put on his shoes again and go away.” In many
cases garments were brought in the giving away of which must have
meant serious deprivation to the givers and yet there was evident joy at
the opportunity of helping those even more unfortunate.</p>

<p class="c015">Only a brief general statement can be made in this Bulletin of the contributions
from the various Branches for San Francisco, the more detailed
report will be given later when the returns are all received. In
this Bulletin the receipts from the Branches for the Japanese Famine
Fund and for the Vesuvian Relief are reported.</p>

<p class="c015">The prompt sympathy that was shown outside our own country for
the California sufferers manifested itself in several cases by generous
appropriations by foreign governments and by contributions from firms
and individuals. These were generally sent to the State Department. As
the President felt that the liberality of our own people would meet the
required aid and, moreover, if accepted by the Government from one
country others might feel a necessity of also making relief appropriations,
it seemed wise to decline with most sincere expressions of thanks such
contributions.</p>

<p class="c015">Acting under the apprehension that the President deemed it best that
no foreign contributions be accepted, two generous contributions made
directly to the Red Cross, one from the Canadian Pacific Railroad and
one from the Chinese Diplomatic and Consular Service in this country,
though deeply appreciated, were declined. In the case of the money offered
by the Chinese Legation and Consuls, the Chinese Minister, at the
suggestion of the Red Cross, placed the contribution in the hands of
the First Secretary of the Chinese Legation, Mr. Chow Tszchi, who was
sent by him to the Pacific Slope with a letter from the Red Cross to
Dr. Devine, requesting the latter to assist in every way possible Mr.
Chow Tszchi’s work for the Chinese sufferers.</p>

<p><span class="pageno" id="Page_17">17</span></p>

<p class="c015">On May 5th the following letter was received by the Honorable Wm.
H. Taft, President of the American National Red Cross:</p>

<p class="c020"><span class="sc">Japanese Embassy, Washington</span>, <i>May 5, 1906</i>.</p>

<p class="c019"><i>Honorable Wm. H. Taft, President of the American National Red Cross</i>:</p>

<p class="c018"><span class="sc">Sir</span>:—I beg to inform you that the Red Cross Society of Japan has
solicited contributions from the general public in Japan for the relief of
distress caused to the population of California by the recent earthquake,
and transmitted to me by telegraph as the first installment the sum of
50,000 dollars with the request that it be applied to the above named
purpose through the kindness of the American National Red Cross.</p>

<p class="c018">Will you kindly inform me at your earliest convenience whether you
can use your good offices in the premises or not?</p>

<p class="c021">Yours sincerely,</p>

<p class="c020">VISCOUNT S. AOKI.</p>

<p class="c015">As information was received that only such contributions as were
made directly to the Government were to be declined, this generous expression
of sympathy consisting of voluntary contributions made through
the Japanese Red Cross to the American National Red Cross for the
purpose of this relief work was accepted by the President of the Red
Cross in the following letter:</p>

<p class="c020"><span class="sc">Washington, D. C.</span>, <i>May 8, 1906</i>.</p>

<p class="c019"><i>Your Excellency</i>:</p>

<p class="c018">I beg to acknowledge the receipt of your favor of the 5th of May, in
which you inform me that the Red Cross Society of Japan has solicited
contributions from the general public in Japan for the relief of distress
caused to the population of California by the recent earthquake, and has
transmitted to you by telegraph the sum of $50,000, with a request that
it be applied to the above-named purpose through the American National
Red Cross. Your Excellency asks that I advise you whether I can use
my good offices in the premises.</p>

<p class="c018">In reply I beg, on behalf of the American National Red Cross, to express
its gratitude and that of the people of California, for the generosity
of the Japanese Red Cross and the people of Japan, and to say that I
shall be glad, on behalf of the American National Red Cross, to receive
the contributions mentioned, and to expend them for the purposes mentioned
in Your Excellency’s letter.</p>

<p class="c018">I have the honor to be, Your Excellency,</p>

<p class="c021">Very sincerely yours,</p>

<p class="c020">WM. H. TAFT,<br />
<i>President, American National Red Cross</i>.</p>

<p class="c019">His Excellency,
<span class="sc">Viscount S. Aoki</span>,
<i>Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary</i>,
Japanese Embassy, Washington.</p>

<p class="c015">On May 21st a second installment was received from Japan and accepted
in the following letter:</p>

<p class="c020"><span class="sc">Washington, D. C.</span>, <i>May 21, 1906</i>.</p>

<p class="c019"><i>Your Excellency</i>:</p>

<p class="c018">I have the honor to acknowledge receipt of your favor of the 21st
of May, enclosing a check for $30,000, which the Red Cross Society of
Japan has raised as the second installment from the general public of
Japan for the relief of distress caused to the inhabitants of California by
the recent earthquake.</p>

<p><span class="pageno" id="Page_18">18</span></p>

<p class="c018">On behalf of the Red Cross, I beg to thank you and your people for the
generous contribution.</p>

<p class="c018">I have the honor to be, Your Excellency,</p>

<p class="c021">Very sincerely yours,</p>

<p class="c020">WM. H. TAFT,<br />
<i>President, American National Red Cross</i>.</p>

<p class="c019">His Excellency,
<span class="sc">Viscount S. Aoki</span>,
<i>Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary</i>,
Japanese Embassy, Washington, D. C.</p>

<p class="c015">That, after the great expense incurred by the late war and the need
of relief at home on a large scale for the famine stricken provinces, so
generous an expression of sympathy for the sufferers in California was
made by the people of Japan, is most deeply appreciated by the American
National Red Cross and the American people.</p>

<p class="c015">Up to the date of going to press the Red Cross has received from the
State Branches and from other sources $2,275,489.56. Four hundred
thousand dollars of this amount has been transmitted to Mr. James Phelan,
as Chairman of the Finance Committee of the consolidated Relief
Committee and Red Cross, and the remainder is subject to the call of
this committee, any sum being at its request immediately forwarded by
telegraph to San Francisco through the U. S. Sub-Treasuries, and placed
to Mr. Phelan’s credit.</p>

<p class="c015">As the general principle of the Red Cross is that money is most wisely
expended as far as possible, near the scene of disaster so as to stimulate
the somewhat paralyzed business-life, and expended by those, who—taking
part in the actual relief work, best understand the needs, the Red Cross
Executive Committee made no purchases save one carload of condensed
milk and ten thousand blankets. In both cases these purchases were
made with the kindly assistance of Army Officers who pronounced on the
prices and inspected the articles before they were shipped, transportation
having been given. The Commissary officers of the U. S. Army throughout
the West kindly consented to act as Purchasing Agents for the Red
Cross, and Dr. Devine who with Mr. Pollok of the Relief Committee
was appointed on a purchasing committee, was notified of their names and
addresses.</p>

<p class="c015">On April 26th the following telegram was received from Judge Morrow,
President of the California Branch:</p>

<p class="c019"><span class="sc">Hon. W. H. Taft</span>, <i>President Red Cross, Washington, D. C.</i></p>

<p class="c018">Have arranged for full historical record of all matters connected with
disaster for Red Cross purposes.</p>

<p class="c020">WM. W. MORROW, <i>President</i>.</p>

<p class="c015">The distinguished historian, Professor H. Morse Stephens, is on this
historical committee and associated with him are some of the most
capable young men who were intimately connected with the relief work
from the first.</p>

<p class="c015">This record will be published later and will not only prove of historical
interest, but of great value in any future relief work of a like nature.</p>

<p class="c015">The importance of having the accounts of the expenditures of Red<span class="pageno" id="Page_19">19</span>
Cross money contributions so kept as to render auditing by the War
Department possible, as required by law, was fully realized, and General
A. E. Bates, Retired Paymaster-General of the U. S. Army, kindly volunteered
his services to proceed to San Francisco and arrange some simple
plan for the keeping of these accounts. His offer was accepted, and
at the request of the President of the Red Cross he left for San Francisco,
and on May 9th the following telegram was received by the President
of the Red Cross:</p>

<p class="c019"><i>The Secretary of War, Washington, D. C.</i>:</p>

<p class="c018">Arrived Monday evening and yesterday had an interview with the Finance
Committee by whom I was most pleasantly received. Examined
their system of auditing which I approve. Suggest an addition to their
system by which the Red Cross funds will be treated like an appropriation
for a specific purpose and accounted for to you by vouchers and
accounts similar to money of Army appropriation. My suggestion approved
and adopted by Committee and Dr. Devine with thanks. Relief
work here is perfectly organized and organization apparently working
effectively and smoothly. Expenses being reduced daily. This morning
I appeared by request before the full Committee and explained my position
here. Shall remain here until system is working and one set of
accounts is forwarded.</p>

<p class="c020">A. E. BATES, <i>Major-General, retired</i>.</p>

<p class="c015">The following communication was received by the Secretary of the
Red Cross from Judge Morrow, enclosing the literature referred to:</p>

<p class="c020"><span class="sc">California Branch, San Francisco, Cal.</span>, <i>May 12, 1906</i>.</p>

<p class="c019"><span class="sc">Mr. Charles L. Magee</span>, <i>Secretary, American Red Cross</i>:</p>

<p class="c019"><span class="sc">Dear Sir</span>:</p>

<p class="c018">The distribution of food to the nearly three hundred thousand sufferers
in San Francisco has been a difficult problem for solution, but
we think a system has been adopted that will make the distribution as
nearly perfect as possible, and as the subject may be of some interest
to the National Society, I enclose herewith the plan of registering
of persons desiring food, the directions for registering applicants at relief
stations; also a registration card and a food card.</p>

<p class="c018">You may, perhaps, find it interesting, and I would suggest that you
show it to Mr. President Taft. The plan was devised by Professor C. C.
Plehn of our State University, and we think it would be well to have it
made a matter of record for future reference. The plan goes into
effect immediately.</p>

<p class="c021"><i>Very truly yours</i>,</p>

<p class="c020">WM. W. MORROW,<br />
<i>President, State Branch Society</i>.</p>

<p class="c015">A reproduction of the registration and food cards are given and it is
especially interesting to note that in the Japanese Famine Relief work, as
seen by Baron Ozawa’s report contained in the Bulletin, that the Japanese
Red Cross also used a system of registration.</p>

<p class="c032">“AMERICAN NATIONAL RED CROSS</p>

<p class="c032">“Instructions for Registering Applicants at Relief Stations</p>

<p class="c015">“The primary purpose of this registration is to provide a record that
will show how many persons are applying for relief from the National
Red Cross. Since relief is granted through a large number of sub-stations,
it is necessary not only that each station should keep a register of
its own applicants, but also that the headquarters should have complete
records for all stations.</p>

<p class="c015">“When any one applies for relief, therefore, a Registration Card should
be at once made out showing so far as pertinent and ascertainable the
information asked for concerning the applicant. When rations are issued
to a family or party both the Food Card and the Registration Card should
be made out at the same time. Registration may—and in many cases will—be
done by the canvassers who visit each family. These canvassers
may be: (1) officers of the Relief Station; (2) workers of the Associated
Charities; (3) representatives of the Central Registration Bureau.
The utmost care should be exercised to see that the persons registered
for relief are within the district assigned to the station issuing relief. If
any question as to boundaries arises refer the same to the Central Registration
Bureau.”</p>

<p class="c015">Among the directions for making out the Registration Card are the
following:</p>

<p class="c015">“(1) Surname and initial of applicant.</p>

<p class="c015">“Write legibly the name of the head of the family or party applying for
relief.</p>

<p class="c015">“(5) Present location.</p>

<p class="c015">“Give the best possible indication of where applicant can be found on
visit or by letter.</p>

<p class="c015">“(6) Former address or home on April 17th.</p>

<p class="c015">“What is wanted is the address that will be most useful in tracing the
applicant or his family in case inquiry is made by distant friends or others.</p>

<p class="c015">“(7) Trade or occupation.</p>

<p class="c015">“In case the applicant has a recognized trade enter it; otherwise give
best indication possible of how he made his living.</p>

<p class="c015">“(13) Address of friends to be communicated with.</p>

<p class="c015">“Enter here any names and addresses of people to whom applicant
desires the National Red Cross to write in his behalf.</p>

<p class="c015">“(17) Plans for future.</p>

<p class="c015">“State any plans applicant says he has for future work, for leaving town,
etc., and any fact which may help in putting him on his own feet again.</p>

<p class="c015">“Treat all applicants with the utmost consideration. The relief afforded
is not a charity and is needed most by respected and honorable citizens.<span class="pageno" id="Page_24">24</span>
More than nine out of every ten of the applicants will be self-supporting
in a few weeks. The few lazy imposters will be speedily detected and
dealt with separately. Assume every one to be entitled to relief until
clearly proven unworthy.”</p>

<p class="c015">Under the directions for the issue of Food Cards the purposes for
which Food Cards are issued are stated to be:</p>

<p class="c015">“(1) To make sure that every one entitled to draw rations secures an
amount proportionate to the size of his family or party.</p>

<p class="c015">“(2) To prevent imposters from drawing more than their proportionate
share of rations.</p>

<p class="c015">“(3) To furnish a record of the number of persons being fed at the
several relief stations, for the use of stations, and of the central distributing
authorities.”</p>

<p class="c015">In connection with the Food Cards the following cards have been
issued to provide for the giving out of other supplies:</p>

<p class="c015">The issuing of these cards has reduced the number of repeaters and has
been of great assistance in the systematizing of the relief work.</p>

<p class="c015">General Bates in his report to the President of the American National
Red Cross states later that a further economic and salutary measure has
been adopted in the establishment at the different camps and relief stations
of large kitchens and dining halls or sheds where a contractor buying
the supplies from the relief committee furnishes three cooked meals
a day, and in case of all persons, excepting those who are entirely destitute,
these meals are sold at ten or fifteen cents each. It is the opinion
of the officers in charge of this work, which is just inaugurated, that
within a few days, the greater majority of the people getting relief from<span class="pageno" id="Page_25">25</span>
the Committee in this manner will pay for it. General Bates also says, “I
think it would be quite impossible for any one, without having been on
the ground or having had a similar experience in some other place, to
appreciate the enormous difficulties that these people have had to contend
with. In the first place their three days’ battle with the fire was as horrible,
excepting as to loss of life, as any of the critical battles of the world.
During that time, with the water cut off from the city, the impossibility
to arrest fire by means of dynamiting and blowing up districts so that
the fire should have nothing to feed upon, the suffering and horror of
turning two hundred thousand or more people from their homes into the
streets, with nothing to eat and nothing to drink was simply appalling
and notwithstanding the gigantic task that lay before them, I think from
what I learn, that it is safe to say that no one has suffered from hunger
or neglect.”</p>

the relief in California, but it conveys some idea of the methods adopted
in the accomplishing of this great work.</p>

  <h2 class="c013">THE EIGHTH INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS OF
THE RED CROSS SOCIETIES</h2>
</div>

<p><i>To the Presidents and Members of the Central Committees of the Red
Cross</i>:</p>

<p class="c011"><span class="sc">Geneva</span>, <i>March 20, 1906</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Gentlemen</span>:</p>

<p class="c015">In accordance with an established tradition, duly confirmed by the last
Congress held in St. Petersburg, it is the duty of the International Committee
to concern itself in due time with the reunion of the International
Meetings, which periodically bring together the delegates of all the
National Societies of the Red Cross.</p>

<p class="c015">The British Society not having heretofore been called upon to entertain
the sister organizations of other countries, we addressed ourselves to
the London Committee: We have the pleasure of announcing to our
honorable correspondents that this Committee accepted the mandate which
we proposed it should assume.</p>

<p class="c015">The next International Congress of the Red Cross Societies will therefore
convene in London, 1907, during the week beginning June 10th.</p>

<p class="c015">You will unite with us Gentlemen, will you not, in addressing publicly
to the British Society, the expression of our sincere gratitude for the
invitation extended to us, assuring it at the same time of the zeal with
which we will favorably respond.</p>

<p class="c015">It is important that these periodical occasions, the only ones which
afford to our Societies the opportunity to strengthen the bands which
unite them, by personal and instructive intercourse, should be as largely
attended as possible and that no Society, however modest it be, should
fail to have itself represented.</p>

<p class="c015">The British Society which has so recently been called upon to reap
such a rich harvest in the field of Volunteer Aid, will doubtless have important
communications to make to its guests; moreover its organization
and peculiar workings, will offer an ample subject of study to delegates
assembled to perfect their knowledge in the line of aid to wounded
soldiers.</p>

<p class="c015">It seems of interest to us, to trace in a few lines, the origin of this
Society, thereby learning to know it in advance, because few countries
have shown as much zeal and expended as much money in succoring
wounded soldiers, as Great Britain. This Society owes its existence to
the Members of the Order of St. John of Jerusalem, who conceived the
idea in April, 1869. It was regularly incorporated August 4, 1870. Its
operations were confined at the outset, in time of peace, to the training
of nurses, but in time of war, it played an important and beneficent part
in sending aid in money, or in kind, by furnishing detachments of nurses,<span class="pageno" id="Page_27">27</span>
not only for the wars in which England participated, but also for those
in which she was not engaged.</p>

<p class="c015">In 1899 a British Central Committee of the Red Cross was created,
uniting the delegates of the National Society for Aid to the Wounded,
the Ambulance of St. John and the Reserve Corps of Army Nurses, to
serve as a bond between these three institutions and for the purpose of
distributing in time of war, all voluntary relief contributions, whether
made in personal service, in materials or in funds. It was destined to
enlarge the sphere of action and of influence of the British Red Cross,
and to neutralize the efforts of all the Relief Societies of the country.
The Chairman of the National Society, Lord Wantage, was placed at
the head of this Central Committee, and the new combination proved
efficacious and useful in the Anglo-Boer War, where the Volunteer Sanitary
Service played such an important part.</p>

<p class="c015">Finally in 1905 a new transformation became operative. Lord Wantage,
deceased in 1901, was succeeded by Lord Rothschild. A committee presided
over by the latter, under the auspices of the Queen and in response
to an appeal made by her, was charged with the work of rendering more
effective the concentration of all British Societies concerned with Relief
Work amongst the sick and wounded in the Army. The efforts of this
committee of organization have resulted in an association which assures
to the Red Cross in Great Britain, the position it should occupy. Lord
Rothschild is Chairman of the Executive Committee. We will undoubtedly
be able in the next issue of the “Bulletin” to give more complete
details concerning this entirely recent institution.</p>

<p class="c015">The Headquarters of the British Red Cross Society are at 9 Victoria
St., London, S. W.</p>

<p class="c015">The program of each Congress is as you know, finally arranged by
the Committee of the Country acting as host, according to the subjects
suggested by the other National Societies and also by those which it
desires itself to discuss. We therefore request you to inform the British
Society directly and at your earliest convenience, of the questions
you would wish to see appear on the program for deliberation. The
British Society in transmitting to you the final program, will give full,
practical and necessary directions.</p>

<p class="c015">In accordance with resolutions passed at St. Petersburg, an exhibition
will be held in connection with the next Congress, with the object of
showing the technical progress made in relief methods. Moreover the
prize founded by the Empress Marie-Feodorovna, will be awarded for
the first time, to the authors of the best inventions for alleviating the
sufferings of sick and wounded soldiers.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1">[1]</a> The inventions to be shown
at the aforesaid exhibition. The jury charged with awarding the prize
is composed of eight members, of which two are named by right, one by
the Russian Central Committee, the other by the International Committee;
besides these, the Central Committees charged with designating in 1907,
each a member of the jury, are those of Germany, Austria, Great Britain,
France, Italy and Holland.</p>

<p><span class="pageno" id="Page_28">28</span></p>

<p class="c015">Finally, and in conformity with a decision of the last Congress, we
invite those of the Red Cross Societies which have not yet informed us
of how far they have been able to carry out the wishes and the resolutions
adopted in St. Petersburg, to do so at once, or at least to notify
the London Committee in time to enable them to present a report on the
matter to the Eighth Congress.</p>

<p class="c015">Having given ourselves the pleasure of announcing the gracious invitation
which the British Red Cross Society intends addressing to you,
with the special communications which it will send to you directly, we
beg to renew to that Society the expression of our gratitude and to
present to you, Gentlemen, the assurance of our most distinguished sentiments.</p>

<p class="c015">For the International Committee of the Red Cross:</p>

<p class="c011">G. MOYNIER, <i>President</i>.<br />
E. ODIER, <i>Secretary</i>.<br />
GUSTAVE ADOR, <i>Vice-President</i>.</p>

  <h2 class="c013">THE ABUSE OF THE RED CROSS INSIGNIA</h2>
</div>

<p class="c014">The rapidly increasing prominence and importance of the Red Cross
will still further tend to the abuse of its insignia. Unfortunately in the
United States the use of this insignia, created for the special purpose of
identifying and protecting in time of war those caring for the sick and
wounded, ambulances, hospitals and hospital equipments, has never been
properly safeguarded as has been done in most other countries which
are signatory powers of the treaty of Geneva, and which recognize the
necessity for the protection of this insignia.</p>

<p class="c015">A number of manufactured articles bear as a trademark this insignia,
their manufacturers having obtained from the Patent Office, previous to
the reincorporation of the Red Cross, a legal right to such use. Others
using that mark claim a right to use it because they had used it previous
to the granting of the charter. In a number of cases their attention
being called to the clause of the charter intending to prevent as far as
possible this use of the Red Cross for purposes of trade, manufacturers
and others have kindly and promptly abandoned their use of it. In
other cases the request to desist from its use—it might be called its
abuse—was refused.</p>

<p class="c015">In two cases that have been brought to the notice of the Executive
Committee so-called training schools for nurses that provide, in one case
a course of a few weeks with no hospital experience, and in another a
training by correspondence only, called their nurses Red Cross nurses.
As it is the object of the National Red Cross to enroll among its nurses
only such as have had a regular two or three years’ course with hospital
training, and whose efficiency and character have been thoroughly vouched
for so that our American National Red Cross nurses will rank as highly
as do the Red Cross nurses in many of the other countries, this use of
the Red Cross by such institutions as those mentioned above must act
as a strong detriment to the National Red Cross and prove especially
injurious to its efforts to secure the enrollment of the highest class of
trained nurses.</p>

<p class="c015">Red Cross nurses are enrolled for service in time of war or of great
calamity as provided in the charter and a false impression is conveyed
when nurses not enrolled by the National Red Cross make use of this
name of Red Cross nurse. There can be in each country but one Red
Cross Society as recognized by the International Red Cross Committee
of Geneva upon proof that the Society has received official recognition
from the Government of its own country and only its nurses are really
Red Cross nurses, so that all others using this name convey to the
public a false impression that they are nurses of the Red Cross.</p>

<p class="c015">Public opinion should most strongly oppose the abuse of the Red Cross
insignia, and its use, save for the purposes for which it was created,<span class="pageno" id="Page_30">30</span>
earnestly discountenanced. The members of the Red Cross are requested
to report to the Executive Committee all such use of the Red Cross, not
connected with the National Society, that may come within their cognizance.
The Society has a list of those manufacturers who obtained the Red
Cross as a trademark previous to its reincorporation under the present
charter in January, 1905. It should be the duty of every American to
see to it that in our country this Red Cross insignia, created for so
beneficient a purpose, is protected as far as possible from the degradation
of becoming a mere advertisement for money making designs.</p>

  <h2 class="c013">NOTES</h2>
</div>

<p class="c014">On April 16th the Headquarters of the American National Red Cross
were moved to the office, room 341, provided for them in the Surgeon-General’s
Division of the War Department. Through the kindness of
Mr. F. A. Keep some new articles of furniture were purchased for the
office, and the more spacious quarters and better equipment for office
work have proved of the greatest advantage in the large amount of additional
labor entailed by the San Francisco Relief.</p>

<hr class="c016" />

<p class="c015">The delegates appointed by the U. S. Government to represent it at
the Convention of Geneva for the Revision of the Red Cross Treaty,

of the U. S. Army, who is also Chairman of the Red
Cross Central Committee; Rear Admiral Charles S. Sperry, U. S. Navy,
and Colonel William Cary Sanger, President of the New York Red Cross
Branch. A report for the Bulletin on the revisions agreed upon by this
Convention will be made by one of the U. S. delegates.</p>

<hr class="c016" />

<hr class="c016" />

<p class="c015">The records of the Philippine Red Cross Branch show a membership
of 119 annual and 4 life members.</p>

<p class="c015">On December 30th there died at Manila Captain Joaquin Monet of
the Manila police force as the direct result of a cold contracted in the
performance of duty during the tornado which devastated Manila and
particularly his precinct, Paso, on the 26th day of last September, when
for twenty-four hours he worked without changing his wet clothing,
amidst live electric wires, in the ravages of storm and flood, to protect
property and to relieve the sufferings and fears of people under his care.
He left a widow and children, and as there is no provision for pensions
for the families of men who give themselves at the call of duty, the
Philippine Red Cross Society decided to appropriate out of its relief
funds $15.00 a month for six months for the support of this man’s family,
and the Secretary of the Philippine Red Cross writes: “Had you relieved
only this one case it is worth the while to have founded here a Branch
of the National Red Cross.”</p>

<hr class="c016" />

<p class="c015">Hon. A. C. Kaufman, President of the South Carolina Branch of the
Red Cross, writes as follows:</p>

<p class="c018">The formation and management of a Red Cross Branch, in this section,
has called for extreme diplomacy, conservatism and caution. Our effort
has been to place this Branch upon a high plane, following closely the
standard of the parent organization.</p>

<p class="c018">By pursuing this course, we have established confidence in the movement,
and have won friends in every portion of the State. That has
been clearly demonstrated in our ability to secure as a Vice-President,
from each of the seven Congressional Districts, in South Carolina, gentlemen
of exalted standing in the social, professional and business walks
of life.</p>

<p class="c018">The following is a complete list of the Vice-Presidents of the South
Carolina Branch: First Congressional District, Maj. Theodore G. Barker,
Charleston; Second Congressional District, Hon. D. S. Henderson, Aiken;
Third Congressional District, Rev. James A. B. Scherer, Ph.D., Newberry;
Fourth Congressional District, Rev. Robert P. Pell, Litt D.,
Spartanburg; Fifth Congressional District, Col. Leroy Springs, Lancaster;
Sixth Congressional District, Hon. W. D. Morgan, Georgetown;
Seventh Congressional District, Hon. W. C. Benet, Columbia.</p>

<p class="c018">Again, we have done well under the circumstances, in contributions
that have come to us, in aid of sufferers of Japan, Italy and San Francisco.
Our purpose was, not to go around begging alms, but to trust to
the generosity of our fellow citizens, and thereby to test their confidence
in us, as representatives of this great International body. The success
of this plan has been shown in the reports that have been made by us
to the National Headquarters. Every penny we have accounted for has
been a voluntary gift, that has come to us, not been run after. This<span class="pageno" id="Page_33">33</span>
dignified course has produced a marked effect upon the people of the
State who have witnessed this well ordered procedure. This plan may
have diminished somewhat the amount of our receipts, but it has raised
the organization very high in the estimation and respect of the entire
citizenship of our State.</p>

<p class="c018">The Branch is now in a most healthy and flourishing condition and we
feel proud of the position it occupies in the brilliant galaxy of Red Cross
Branches.</p>

<hr class="c016" />

<p class="c015">The Secretary of the Michigan Branch, Mr. R. M. Dyar, writes under
date of June 6:</p>

<p class="c018">We have adopted a method for increasing our membership of getting
in communication with men in small towns, who acted as Treasurer or
Chairman of local relief committees for the San Francisco Fund, our idea
being to appoint such men as Vice-Presidents and to have them decide
on becoming members themselves, and endeavor to secure additional
members in their cities or towns.</p>

<hr class="c016" />

<p class="c015">The following is a list of the Sub-divisions of the Massachusetts
Branch, with the officers of each:</p>

<p class="c015">Worcester County.—Chairman, Charles G. Washburn; Treasurer, Dr.
Homer Gage; Secretary, Mrs. Lincoln W. Kinnicutt.</p>

<p class="c015">Berkshire County.—President, Judge John C. Crosby; Vice-President,
Rev. J. C. Smoots; Secretary and Treasurer, Dr. Alfreda B. Withington;
Executive Committee: Dr. J. F. A. Adams, Mrs. H. A. Brewster, Miss
Julia W. Redfield, Rev. James Boyle, Pittsfield; Mrs. W. Murray Crane,
Jr., Dalton; Miss Cornelia Barnes, Lenox; Miss Caroline T. Lawrence,
Stockbridge; Mrs. William Stanley, Great Barrington.</p>

<p class="c015">Hampden County.—President, Mr. George Dwight Pratt; Treasurer,
Mr. Ralph P. Alden; Secretary, Miss Amy B. Alexander.</p>

<p class="c015">A Division is being organized in Essex County, of which Gen. Francis
H. Appleton will be Chairman and Mr. W. O. Chapman, of the Asiatic
Bank, Salem, Treasurer.</p>

<p class="c015">The Secretary of the Massachusetts Branch, Miss Katherine P. Loring,
reports that, “A man has been representing himself as an agent of the
Red Cross and has been begging for subscriptions for our purposes. We
have put notices in the newspapers and have notified the police that we
never employ agents.”</p>

<hr class="c016" />

<p class="c015">The Connecticut Branch reports six Sub-divisions and another in process
of formation. They have a total membership of 900, including 89
life members. Of the foregoing membership four hundred are members
of the Norwich Society.</p>

<p class="c015">The Secretary of the Connecticut Branch of the Red Cross in a letter
dated June 12th states that the Bristol Sub-division, which is composed
of twenty-five boys, members of a Sunday-school class, accomplished wonders
in their efforts in behalf of the unfortunate people of California.
They not only collected and shipped to California clothing, blankets, linen,
etc., amounting to 1272 pieces, but contributed in cash $1,235.04. No
better work than this has been done by any organization, and as Mrs.
Kinney says—good for the boys!</p>

<p><span class="pageno" id="Page_34">34</span></p>

<p class="c015">The New York State Branch now has twelve sub-divisions. Since the
April number of the Bulletin, four new sub-divisions have been organized,
namely: Chautauqua County, Columbia County, Duchess County
and New York County. It is probable that organization will be effected
soon in Chemung, Oswego and St. Lawrence Counties. Work is now
progressing and organization is under consideration in seven other Counties,
namely: Broome, Greene, Orange, Nassau, Suffolk, Tompkins and
Jefferson.</p>

<p class="c015">The membership of the sub-divisions is as follows:</p>

</table>

<p class="c015">In other counties of the State there are forty-nine members, making
the total membership for the State, so far as reported on June 16th, one
thousand, six hundred and thirty-six.</p>

<p class="c015">The Americans in London sent through the Honorable Whitelaw Reid,
the American Ambassador, $20,000.00 for the California Fund.</p>

<p class="c015">The New York County Sub-division opened two clothing depots where
contributions of clothing were received, assorted, repacked and shipped,
sending 181 cases to San Francisco. During the first three weeks every
night a list of supplies that day shipped or en route was sent to Dr.
Devine. Service was also systematically arranged in telegraphing inquiries
for missing relatives and friends and forwarding the information
when received. The business public evinced the greatest interest and most
practical coöperation in the relief work by furnishing free service and
by lending or giving ample equipment to carry on the work.</p>

<p class="c015">The work of the State Branch has so increased as to render it necessary
to move into a larger office—Room No. 507—in the same building,
No. 500 Fifth Avenue, New York City.</p>

<hr class="c016" />

<p class="c032">PENNSYLVANIA BRANCH HEADQUARTERS.</p>

<p class="c011"><span class="sc">Philadelphia</span>, Independence Hall Building, <i>June 14, 1906</i>.</p>

<p class="c015">We awoke the day after the earthquake horrified to read in the morning
papers that California had been devastated and San Francisco was
in flames. It needed no second reading to know that a call for help would
soon reach us, so our officers and executive committee reported to our
State Headquarters where soon the expected telegram from Washington<span class="pageno" id="Page_35">35</span>
was received. It was a brief message instructing us to issue an appeal
and appoint local treasurers.</p>

<p class="c015">Our official printer, who, by special arrangement, is obligated to take
our copy and run on our emergency work night and day, was in a few
hours delivering to headquarters the necessary printed matter.</p>

<p class="c015">“The Society for Organizing Charities,” represented by Miss Richmond
and Mr. Esterbrook, volunteered to do the addressing of our appeals
and at an hour’s notice had more than a score of their splendid young
lady volunteers addressing and mailing our Red Cross appeal, using their
Charity list of fifteen thousand selected names.</p>

<p class="c015">By a wise arrangement our Secretary is authorized to make emergency
expenditures subject to reimbursement at later meeting of the Executive
Committee, so the postage alone of some $300 was made instantly available
from his personal funds.</p>

<p class="c015">In all such appeals it is vital to determine the psychological moment of
greatest effect and the force of our appeal was at its highest on Monday
morning following the reading of the Sunday papers.</p>

<p class="c015">An early call was sent to each city daily and evening newspaper and a
publicity department was established where all telegrams, letters, abstracts
and daily subscription lists were furnished in typewritten copy
to all reporters. Such returns must be made quickly and we kept a regular
volunteer force of messengers taking reports at certain convenient
intervals to newspaper headquarters. These State Headquarters realizing
the necessity and value of the coöperation of the towns, other than
Philadelphia, throughout the commonwealth, promptly acted upon the
suggestion of President Talcott Williams and the Secretary who were
in daily conference with heads of all departments. A telegram was therefore
sent to some two hundred towns throughout the State, addressing
the leading bank, or trust company, asking them to confer with their
Mayor or Chief Burgess as chairman, appointing a Red Cross Committee,
and with aid of local newspapers to publish a fund and solicit subscriptions,
same to be promptly forwarded to State Treasurer, Mrs. Alexander
J. Cassatt, at Philadelphia, who daily deposited the amounts received for
transmission to Washington. An immediate response was forthcoming
from some score of towns and in a few days the funds were massing up.</p>

<p class="c015">This secured the hearty interest and coöperation of thousands of citizens
of the State and established the groundwork of Red Cross Sub-Branches
in every city, hamlet and village.</p>

<p class="c015">The State Headquarters, at Philadelphia, in the old Independence Hall
Building, with its Executive Committee and volunteer clerks, stenographers
and messengers was a busy office for the three weeks following the
disaster.</p>

<p class="c015">Our facilities were admirable to the purpose. The two telephone companies,
the Bell and Keystone, gave us free of cost each three extra
telephones of unlimited service. The Postal and Western Union Telegraph
companies franked our official messages. The Adams, United
States and Wells Fargo Express companies sent forward our packages<span class="pageno" id="Page_36">36</span>
free of charge and the Relief Trains of the <i>North American</i> and <i>Evening
Telegraph</i> put their cars at our disposal, and sent their wagons for our
heavy freight, thereby greatly assisting us with a matter that was assuming
serious proportions.</p>

<p class="c015">The Ladies’ Auxiliary Committees under the able advice of Mrs. John
Dye, herself a veteran nurse of the Civil War and a trained Red Cross
worker of the Spanish War, took full charge of the packing and inspection
of all materials submitted and nothing of worthless or inappropriate
kind went forward bearing the tag of the Pennsylvania Branch.</p>

<p class="c015">It was an honor and privilege extended our Secretary to act in conjunction
with the National body in the purchase of large quantities of
Army Blankets from local mills. These vital essentials were early despatched
by rush express to the Red Cross Field Agents in San Francisco
and thus can the State Branches assist the great National Headquarters
in other ways than the forwarding of funds alone.</p>

<p class="c015">An item of a thousand baby nursing bottles and a dozen boxes of infant
necessaries and a shipment of condensed milk for future ’Frisco
citizens shows that the little ones were also well remembered.</p>

<p class="c015">In Philadelphia, Pittsburgh and other of our large cities there has
existed for years many splendid and efficient Permanent Relief and Citizens
Emergency Committees all of whom, with the many trades organizations,
were early in the field with their appeals. Though the millions
of dollars thus raised were speedily and properly expended it yet served
to exhaust the giving power of many who would have gladly subscribed
to the Red Cross appeal.</p>

<p class="c015">This serves to urge us to the immediate completion of a full State
organization of Sub-divisions, and any of our Pennsylvania citizens reading
this would help our cause should they proceed to organize local
bodies and address these Headquarters for instructions.</p>

<p class="c015">It is impossible in so brief a report to mention the many incidents of
our “California Earthquake and San Francisco Fire Appeal” as we called
it. The pathetic letters, the sad plight of the refugees who came to us
for succor and employment, of our inquiries for the dead and missing,
of the free telegraphic bureau and of the letters written by the many
who called to ask a seemingly hopeless question. Nor must we overlook
thanking Dr. Devine for his quick and always satisfactory replies to our
inquiries. The marvel of it all is that it was possible to so quickly bring
the relief work to such a state of high potential efficiency, conclusive and
splendid record of the success of the National Red Cross and its responsible
State Branches. In a later report we will send you a list of
the Pennsylvania State towns with their financial statements of subscriptions
sent through these Headquarters. We wish now to thank the citizens
of the entire State and particularly of those cities that responded
so promptly and so liberally.</p>

<p class="c015">“Who gives quickly gives twice.”</p>

<p class="c032">Very respectfully yours,</p>

<p class="c011">JOSEPH ALLISON STEINMETZ.<br />
<i>Secretary for Pennsylvania.</i></p>

<hr class="c016" />

<p><span class="pageno" id="Page_37">37</span></p>

<p class="c015">The National Secretary received the following letter from Miss Emily
P. Bissell, Secretary of the Delaware Branch, who is making a tour of
Europe:</p>

<p class="c020"><span class="sc">Rome</span>, <i>May 27, 1906</i>.</p>

<p class="c019"><span class="sc">Mr. Charles L. Magee</span>,
<i>Secretary the American National Red Cross,
Washington, D. C.</i></p>

<p class="c019"><span class="sc">My Dear Mr. Magee</span>:</p>

<p class="c018">I am sorry to say that I could not find out anything much about Red
Cross relief work in Naples. When I landed there on May 8th, the
eruption of Vesuvius was a thing of the past. The streets were all
cleaned up, the roads open, and the people who had at first crowded into
the city from the destroyed towns had all been sent back or away. I
went to the Red Cross rooms, and was shown the garments for distribution,
which a committee of ladies had been attending to. That was the
only sign of activity there, and only one man, and he not an official, but
a subordinate, was in the rooms. He told me all the relief work now
carried on was in the towns themselves—Bosco Tre Case and Ottajano.
So I started off for them next day.</p>

<p class="c018">Bosco Tre Case is very easy to reach and to examine. The road is
clear, up to where the mass of lava has blocked the railway. The officers
of the municipality, three in number, were standing at the entrance of
the road into the village, with a plate, asking contributions from the
tourists, who were driving through in numbers. The lava, a black, rough
mass, covering fields, and what had been houses, was still smoking. But
its path was not very wide, this village only being destroyed, and on each
side of it the fields were in their usual state. The destruction in the
path of the lava was absolutely complete, of course. I could not find
any Red Cross people there, so I drove on to Pompeii, and took the next
train to Ottajano. As we went up toward Ottajano, the ashes began to
show in the fields. At first only a thin gray dust, they increased as we
ascended. It was a pitiful sight, the vineyards and orchards dying in
the ashes. It was like a tremendous snowfall, with drifts here and there,
but smooth in most places. For miles, the vineyards are three feet deep
in ashes. Here and there, women and children, with small baskets on
their heads, were laborously carrying away the ashes and dumping them
on the side of the roads. But it would be about as easy to empty Lake
Erie with a tablespoon. At Ottajano, I found the army and the Red
Cross in full control. Seven hundred homeless people are here cared
for. One thousand have been sent to friends or to America, or scattered
here and there where work can be found for them. The Red Cross
people said that it was impossible to tell how long those who remained
would have to be looked after. Perhaps six months would not be
enough. Three hundred was too large an estimate, they said, of those
killed in the eruption; but certainly over one hundred had perished, and
very likely many more. The soldiers and the men were at work digging
ashes, and casting them away on tiny freight cars. The women were
sitting in groups, with nothing to do. Some sewing is now being given
out by the Red Cross. The houses are full of ashes to the second story,
and the roofs either gone altogether, or broken and unsafe from the
weight of the ashes on them. The Red Cross gives out rations and
clothes and seems to be extremely well conducted. There are various
officials and Sisters of Mercy, all working constantly and with great
system.</p>

<p class="c018">The covering of the fields by ashes is the worst part of the disaster,
for it means that the livelihood of the people is gone for an indefinite
time. They are hardworking, deserving peasants, and now their crops
are gone, and the soil will not bear anything for three or four years,
till the ashes are assimilated. They are far too deep to be plowed in at<span class="pageno" id="Page_38">38</span>
present. There is no possible place to dump them. Every road is full,
every waste space heaped up high.</p>

<p class="c018">The Red Cross has not as yet published any bulletin or account of their
work. They will do so, however, in the end. Of course they need money,
and will continue to need it for months. I hope America can send them
some, for they certainly deserve it.</p>

<p class="c021">Sincerely yours,</p>

<p class="c020">EMILY P. BISSELL.</p>

<hr class="c016" />

<p class="c015">Items from the April <i>Bulletin</i> of the Red Cross International Committee
of Geneva.</p>

<p class="c015">The <i>Bulletin</i> contains a report of the hospital sent to and maintained in
Manchuria by the German Red Cross Society. The equipment filled 24
cars, providing for a hospital of 120 beds, a disinfecting apparatus, Röntgen
plant, a bacteriological laboratory, and provisions for six months. Its
personnel consisted of the Chief Surgeon, four Assistant Surgeons, two
students, an administrator, a technical officer, 12 sister nurses and nine
lay nurses. A large part of the personnel spoke Russian. Dr. Brentano,
the Chief Surgeon, who considered the collaboration of feminine service
of inestimable value, exacted that the sister nurses should belong to
strictly religious orders, and that the character of the lay nurses should
be strongly vouched for.</p>

<p class="c015">At the termination of the war, in returning to their country, 59 Japanese
officers and 1721 soldiers who had been prisoners in Russia passed
through Germany. For those who had been sick or wounded the German
Red Cross turned the cars into veritable hospitals. At Berlin, upon
order of the Emperor and Empress, the German Red Cross prepared a
reception for them. Tea, cigarettes and some Japanese papers were distributed
among them. At Hamburg the transportation of the sick and
wounded to the ship was quickly accomplished by the Red Cross sanitary
columns, and those who were well taken by a Red Cross detachment to
see the city.</p>

<hr class="c016" />

<p class="c015">In France a movement is on foot to organize a volunteer automobile
corps for the transportation of wounded. With the excellent roads that
exist in that country, the wounded could often be transported in a few
hours by automobiles to the reserve hospitals—thirty or forty miles from
the front—instead of by the slow process of transportation by ambulance.</p>

<p class="c015">It is proposed to organize a volunteer corps of chauffeurs, including
women, who are experts in the running of these machines.</p>

<hr class="c016" />

<p class="c015">In Italy the Red Cross has been continuing its great anti-malarial work
in the Roman Campagna. It has several stations, and each station has a
wagon, an ambulance and medical supplies, and a personnel of a medical
officer, a man nurse and a conductor, each giving two months’ service.</p>

<p class="c015">In 1900 when the work began, 31 per cent. of those receiving the preventive
treatment suffered from the fever. The report for 1905 shows
that only a little over 5 per cent. were attacked by the malady; that is,
out of 16,427 treated only 839 suffered from fever.</p>

<p><span class="pageno" id="Page_39">39</span></p>

<p class="c015">The Red Cross of the Netherlands reports relief rendered to a village
which was partially destroyed by fire.</p>

<hr class="c016" />

<p class="c015">The <i>Bulletin</i> contains a long article on the Russian Red Cross. On
January 1, 1905, not including Port Arthur, it had 158 ambulances of
various kinds including hospital trains, and hospital accommodations in
Manchuria for 27,911. This article shows so strongly the need of system
and preparation beforehand that it is hoped a portion of it may be
printed in some subsequent <i>Bulletin</i> of the American National Red Cross.</p>

<hr class="c016" />

<p class="c015">The Saxon Red Cross reports 70 Sanitary Columns with 2161 members,
all of whom have received a special course of instruction. At Loschwitz
a house for convalescents has been established and utilized for German
soldiers returning from campaigns in South Africa.</p>

<hr class="c016" />

<p class="c015">The importance of the Revision of the Treaty of Geneva and some
of the subjects to be discussed, for which the Convention is now being
held in that city, occupies considerable space in the <i>International Bulletin</i>.
Among the questions are: the protection of the wounded from ill treatment
and pillage, the wearing by all military persons of some mark of
identification, a provision that a list of the dead, the wounded and sick
found or taken by the enemy shall be sent as soon as possible to the
opposing Army or its government, a complete enumeration of the sanitary
personnel protected by the Treaty, if in this enumeration shall be
included the personnel of the volunteer aid, and under what conditions?
Fourteen questions are given.</p>

<hr class="c016" />

<p class="c015">It is much regretted by the National Officers that so few of the Branch
Societies have sent in any notes for publication in this number of the
<span class="sc">Bulletin</span>.</p>

<p class="c015">Copies of this quarterly <span class="sc">Bulletin</span> are sent to all foreign Red Cross
Societies and to every member of the American National Red Cross free
of charge.</p>

<p class="c015">Members of the Red Cross may obtain from the Secretary of the
Branch to which he or she belongs a Red Cross pin or button upon the
payment of fifty cents.</p>

<p class="c015">The new life-membership certificates are now being sent out from the
National Headquarters, and any life member not receiving one will confer
a favor by notifying the National Secretary.</p>

<p class="c015">The Red Cross is having made some special pins to be worn by Red
Cross nurses. These will be furnished the nurses without charge.</p>
